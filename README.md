**--Personal--**  
\*These are my notes for a Udemy course on C++. I probably will add more info to these notes in 2024's Summer. \*
I made this file a few summers ago to learn and play with cpp.
It contains info to learn cpp. It could be useful to someone who is learning cpp and coming from a Python background.
